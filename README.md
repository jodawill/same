SameGame

This is a SameGame clone with vi-like commands. You can navigate with either the arrows or 'hjkl'. Press 'u' to undo and 'x', 'dd', or return to delete blocks. When you press ':', you will be prompted for a command. Enter an empty string to cancel, type 'q' to quit, 'x' to save and quit,  'w' to save, or 'u' to undo.

The game is playable and has an unlimited undo feature, but it currently does not check to see whether the game has ended. This (and a highscore table) will come soon.
