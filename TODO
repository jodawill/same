// General
* Separate the main loop from the logic so different event systems can
  can be used
* draw.c probably needs to completely go away in favor of graphics.c, which
  will eventually contain build options for multiple GUI platforms
* Add GTK support
* Remember filename throughout game
* Upon exit, create a script so the program will reopen in the same state
  as before.
